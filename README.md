# Adafruit OLED Bonnet &lt;-> Orac UI

## I2C and Bridge Install


Firstly, if you haven't already you need to activate the I2C interface on your Raspberry Pi.

From the command line or Terminal window start by running the following command :

```
sudo raspi-config
```

Highlight the “I2C” option and activate, follow the instructions through and reboot your Raspberry Pi.




Now, install OracBonnetBridge.py on your Raspberry Pi:

```
git clone https://github.com/neonmik/orac-controller
cd orac-controller
sudo ./install.sh
sudo halt
```

Connect the Adafruit OLED Bonnet to your Raspberry Pi and power back on, and us the following code to connect to Orac and display the UI:

```
sudo service orac-bonnet-bridge start
```

If you would like to have it start on boot, simple use:

```
sudo systemctl enable orac-bonnet-bridge.service
```


**Note**: the Adafruit bonnet will only work if you **disable** the pisound button functions. You can do this in patchbox from the commandline, or via ssh.

I don't have a pisound, so I'm not sure on the compatability, but I'm aware one of the buttons on this controller fires the pisound button funtions.

## Controls

On the menu screen:

* Up and Down - move between the lines.
* Left and Right - move between the modules.
* A (#6) - activate the selected item.
* B (#5)- go to the parameters screen.

On the parameters screen:

* Up and Down - move between the parameters.
* Left and Right:
    * If a param is activated, decrease and increase its value respectively.
    * Otherwise go to previous or next parameter page.
* A - activate the currently selected parameter for changing the value. 
* B goes to the menu screen.

## Notes and Caveats

* This impletentaion is still a little laggy.
* I've only tested this on a Raspberry PI 3B+ and an Adafruit OLED Bonnet, although I'm sure it will work with other OLED's running I2C (address 0x3C) and any old tact switches. See pinout [here](https://pinout.xyz/pinout/oled_bonnet).
* I've not managed to implement Midi on the params yet.
